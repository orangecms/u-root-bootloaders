## Building the slides

To build the slides, you will need [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), the Source
Sans Pro font and the Twitter Color Emoji font. Just run `make` to build them.

If you don't have the Source Sans Pro font, you can remove the respective line
from the `Makefile`, or just rewrite it / pick up the command from there and
adjust it if you have a different environment. The few emoji used in `slides.md`
can also be removed or the font changed in case you don't have the Twitter Color
Emoji font.
